# 🏥 Hospital Patient Linked List

This project is a simple implementation of a **Singly Linked List** in C++.  
It represents how a hospital can manage a list of patients by adding them at the **beginning**, **end**, and displaying the complete list.

This was created as part of **Lab 5 – Linked Lists**.
